# CLIs

Along with the Aserto Console and the API, Aserto provides three CLI tools:

- The [`aserto` CLI](aserto-cli/installation) allows developers interact with Aserto. It has three main functions:

  - Manage [organization](../architecture/organization) artifacts (policies, directory, connections)
  - Interact with an [Authorizer](../architecture/authorizer/overview)
  
  All management operations are done in the context of an Aserto [_organization_](../architecture/organization).

- The [`policy` CLI](policy-cli/download) allows developers interact with policy images. It has two main functions:

  - Build, sign, and export (unbundle) policy images
  - Push and pull policy images from a policy registry, such as the Aserto Policy Registry or the [Open Policy Registry](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/)

- The [`aserto-idp` CLI](aserto-idp-cli/installation) allows developers to import user data from an Identity Provider into Aserto.
