# decision_logs

The `decision_logs` API provides a means of listing and retrieving decision logs objects.

## URL

`GET .../api/v1/decision_logs/decision_logs`

This form returns a list of names of available decision log storage objects, each of which can be provided to the
second form of this API to retrieve a secure download location (URL):

`GET .../api/v1/decision_logs/decision_logs/{name}`

Where `name` was previously retrieved using the list call. Note that storage object names must be
URL-encoded before using them to retrieve a download location.

## Example

Given a hypothetical tenant with a policy with policy id `18d6580f-7fb0-11ec-bdd9-01c9e2c2068b`, the list call to
retrieve those decision log object names is:

`GET .../api/v1/decision_logs/decision_logs?policies=18d6580f-7fb0-11ec-bdd9-01c9e2c2068b`

Note that omitting the policies parameter would retrieve object names for all the policies.

The response would be similar to:

```json
{
  "page": {
    "next_token": "",
    "result_size": 3,
    "total_size": 0
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "18d6580f-7fb0-11ec-bdd9-01c9e2c2068b/decisions-2022-01-28-00"
    },
    {
      "name": "18d6580f-7fb0-11ec-bdd9-01c9e2c2068b/decisions-2022-01-28-01"
    },
    {
      "name": "18d6580f-7fb0-11ec-bdd9-01c9e2c2068b/decisions-2022-01-28-04"
    }
  ]
}
```

Passing one of the resulting names to the retrieval call and taking care to URL-encode the name:

`GET .../api/v1/decision_logs/decision_logs/18d6580f-7fb0-11ec-bdd9-01c9e2c2068b%2Fdecisions-2022-01-28-00`

Yields a response similar to:

```json
{
  "log": {
    "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/..."
  }
}
```

`url` can be used to download the object, which is a CSV file, using standard HTTP tools. The URL is signed
and valid for 15 minutes.
