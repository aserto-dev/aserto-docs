# Set up PeopleFinder

PeopleFinder is a demo application that will help us understand how Aserto works. In this section, we'll set up your tenant's directory with demo users and then deploy the PeopleFinder applciation to Netlify.

## Load the demo Acmecorp Users

The PeopleFinder application operates over users with roles (such as `viewer`, `editor` and `admin`,) as well as attributes (such as `department`, `title` and `manager`). In order to simulate such a user set, a we are going use the `acmecorp` user directory and load it into your tenant. Once you are done with this example, you'll be able to remove this user set from your tenant.

Navigate to the “Connections” tab

![connections-tab](/getting-started-acmecorp/connections-tab.png)

and click “Add a connection”

![add-connection-button](/getting-started-acmecorp/add-connection-button.png)

Next, select the acmecorp provider:

![add-acmecorp-connections](/getting-started-acmecorp/add-acmecorp-connections.png)

Name the provider (you can choose whatever name you want) and give it a description.

Finally click “Add connection”

![add-connection-button](/getting-started-acmecorp/add-connection-button.png)

When a new connection to an identity provider is added, Aserto automatically imports the users from that identity provider into the Aserto Directory. The users loaded into the directory have different roles and attributes that will help us understand how authorization works. To see them, click on the users tab:

![users-tab](/getting-started-acmecorp/users-tab.png)

Use the directory filter to find the user “Euan Garden”:

![directory-filter](/getting-started-acmecorp/directory-filter.png)

![euan-garden-card](/getting-started-acmecorp/euan-garden-card.png)

Click on the user card and examine the JSON object (shortened here for brevity):

```
{
  "id": "cirkzmrhzgmzos03mzm1ltqwngqtywy2ni1jnzdjzjezyte1zjgsbwxvy2fs",
  "display_name": "Euan Garden",
  ...
  "identities": {
    ...
  },
  "attributes": {
    "properties": {
      "department": "Sales Engagement Management",
      "manager": "2bfaa552-d9a5-41e9-a6c3-5be62b4433c8",
      "phone": "+1-804-555-3383",
      "title": "Salesperson"
    },
    "roles": [
      "acmecorp",
      "sales-engagement-management",
      "user",
      "viewer"
    ],
    "permissions": []
  },
  "applications": {},
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2021-11-08T21:16:13.883383606Z",
    "updated_at": "2021-11-08T21:16:13.883383606Z",
    "deleted_at": null
  },
  "deleted": false
}

```

As you can see here, Euan has the role of a `viewer` (among others), and he is a member of the “Sales Engagement Management” department. Let’s look at another user: go back to the Directory and search for the user Kris Johnsen.

```
{
  "id": "cirknjriodq3ni0zyzvmltrjywytywy2zi05ytbmmwm1mwqxowysbwxvy2fs",
  "display_name": "Kris Johnsen",
  ...
  "identities": {
    ...
  },
  "attributes": {
    "properties": {
      "department": "Operations",
      "manager": "a528dc1d-0042-484d-81cb-dc58c95d8147",
      "phone": "+1-206-555-9001",
      "title": "IT Manager"
    },
    "roles": [
      "acmecorp",
      "admin",
      "operations",
      "user"
    ],
    "permissions": []
  },
  "applications": {},
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2021-11-09T11:16:16.289969130Z",
    "updated_at": "2021-11-09T11:16:16.289969130Z",
    "deleted_at": null
  },
  "deleted": false
}
```

Kris has the _role_ of `admin` (among others) and she is a member of the Operations department. Information in the user object is made available to the policies used by the Aserto authorizer at runtime to make a decision as to whether a user has access to a resource or not. Later in this tutorial we’ll see how to reference the user object in our policies.

## Deploy the PeopleFinder sample to Netlify

Bring up the [peoplefinder sample application repo on GitHub](https://github.com/aserto-dev/peoplefinder-acmecorp), and click the “Deploy to Netlify” button to initiate the deployment to your Netlify account (if you don’t have one, you’ll be prompted to create one - it’s free and awesome!)

![deploy-to-netlify](/getting-started-acmecorp/deploy-to-netlify.png)

You should see a screen like the following, which asks you to connect to your GitHub:

[<img src="/getting-started-acmecorp/netlify-connect-github.png" width="700px" />](/getting-started-acmecorp/netlify-connect-github.png)

Once you complete the OAuth2 flow and authorize Netlify, you’ll be able to configure your PeopleFinder Netlify site by copying the values from the PeopleFinder policy configuration screen:

![netlify-configuration](/getting-started-acmecorp/netlify-configuration.png)

To find your policy configuration information, open the Policies tab in [https://console.aserto.com/ui/policies](console.aserto.com), and open the `peoplefinder-rbac` policy you created.

On the left sidebar, click on "Policy Settings":

![policy-settings-sidebar](/getting-started-acmecorp/policy-settings-sidebar.png)

Copy the Policy ID, Tenant ID, and Authorizer API key from shown in the Policy Settings view into the Netlify application configuration.

![policy-settings](/getting-started-acmecorp/policy-settings.png)

Finally, click "Save and Deploy". Wait until Netlify completes building and deploying the application, then click on the URL produced by Netlify to open the application.
