# Deploy the PeopleFinder sample to Netlify

Bring up the [peoplefinder sample application repo on GitHub](https://github.com/aserto-demo/peoplefinder-acmecorp) on GitHub, and scroll down to the Deployment section, which has a “Deploy to Netlify” button. Click this button to initiate the deployment to your Netlify account (if you don’t have one, you’ll be prompted to create one - it’s free and awesome!)

You should see a screen like the following, which asks you to connect to your GitHub:

Once you complete the OAuth2 flow and authorize Netlify, you’ll be able to configure your PeopleFinder Netlify site by copying the values from the PeopleFinder policy configuration screen:

To find your policy configuration information, open the Policies tab in [console.aserto.com](https://console.aserto.com/ui/policies), and open the `peoplefinder-rbac` policy you created.

On the left sidebar, click on "Policy Settings":

Copy the Policy ID, Tenant ID, and Authorizer API key from shown in the Policy Settings view into the Netlify application configuration.

Finally, click "Save and Deploy". Wait until Netlify completes building and deploying the application, then click on the URL produced by Netlify to open the application.

## Testing the PeopleFinder application

When Netlify is done deploying your site, click on the deployed PeopleFinder URL to show the app hosted at a custom URL in the `*.netlify.app` domain.
