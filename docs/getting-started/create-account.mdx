# Create an Aserto account and tenant

> Note: Aserto is in private beta. To complete the process of creating an account, you must have an invitation link.

## Complete the account creation process

Go to [console.aserto.com](http://console.aserto.com) and complete the Sign Up experience. If you are in our private beta, we have sent you a “password reset” for the email that we’ve received from you, and you can then change your password and sign on.

## Create your tenant

Once you have an account, you will be asked to create a tenant:

![create-tenant](/create-tenant.png)

When you’ve selected a tenant name, you’ll find yourself on the Policies page, ready to add your first Policy.

## Next steps

Next, you'll create your first Aserto policy.
