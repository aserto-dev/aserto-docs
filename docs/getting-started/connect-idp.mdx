# Connect Auth0 as an identity provider

Aserto needs to connect to one or more identity providers as the source of user attributes and roles. 

As we mentioned, the PeopleFinder sample uses [Auth0](https://www.auth0.com) as its identity provider, and 
so we will connect Aserto to your Auth0 tenant.

## Auth0 machine-to-machine application

In the last section, you imported a set of test users into Auth0 using a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) 
Application. We're going to use the same Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret values to connect 
Aserto to Auth0.

> Ensure that the M2M application is authorized to call the Auth0 management API:

> Ensure the scopes that are authorized include at least `read:users` so that Aserto can read your users.

## Connect Aserto to your Auth0 tenant

Click on the “Connections” Navbar tab to see your connections.

Click on the “Add a connection” button and select "auth0" as the provider type. 
You will be prompted to enter connection parameters:

Copy the Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret from the Auth0 UI into the Aserto UI.

When you click the "Add connection" button, Aserto will display the new connection, and start streaming 
your Auth0 tenant users into the Aserto directory.

## Exploring Users

Once you’ve connected your Auth0 tenant as an Identity Provider and loaded test users, you should be 
able to click the Users tab in the Navbar and see your users stream in using the Directory browser.

> Note: loading users from the Identity Provider into the Aserto Directory is an asynchronous task. 
> If you don't see all your users, you may need to reload the user list using the refresh button.
