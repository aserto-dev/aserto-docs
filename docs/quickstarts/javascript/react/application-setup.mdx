# React Application setup

We’re going to build a very bare bones application for this tutorial. We’ll start by creating an application using the `yarn` react-app generator: In your terminal, execute the following command:

```
yarn create react-app aserto-react-demo
```

You can now `cd` into the newly created folder and start the app:

```
cd aserto-react-demo
yarn start
```

The familiar React logo should appear, indicating that the app is ready to go.

## Adding OIDC dependencies

Now that we have a running React application, we'll continue by installing and then importing the required dependency - `oidc-react`

In your terminal, execute the following command:

```
yarn add oidc-react
```

The following environment variables are used to point your application to Aserto’s demo IDP, so that you don’t have to set one yourself. Create a file called `.env` and add the following:

```
REACT_APP_OIDC_DOMAIN=acmecorp.demo.aserto.com
REACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=acmecorp-app
REACT_APP_OIDC_AUDIENCE=acmecorp-app
REACT_APP_API_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080
```

:::caution note
Make sure the `.env` file is added to the `.gitignore` file so that it is not checked in.
:::

Open the file `index.js` and add the dependency:

```javascript
import { AuthProvider } from "oidc-react";
```

Add the following configuration object:

```javascript
const configuration = {
  authority: `https://${process.env.REACT_APP_OIDC_DOMAIN}/dex`,
  clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID,
  autoSignIn: true,
  responseType: "id_token",
  scope: "openid profile email",
  redirectUri: window.location.origin,
  audience: process.env.REACT_APP_OIDC_AUDIENCE,
  onSignIn: () => {
    window.location.replace(window.location.origin);
  },
};
```

Next, we'll wrap the top level React Application component with the AuthProvider, and pass it the required configuration we created.

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <AuthProvider {...configuration}>
      <App />
    </AuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

:::caution note
When developing locally, make sure your application is running on port 3000 - other ports are not registered with the identify provider and will not work.
:::

If your application is still running, you should see the following login window:

![login-window](/quickstart-react-and-node/login-window.png)

Use the following user credentials to log in:

Email address: euang@acmecorp.com

Password: V@erySecre#t123!

After logging in, you should see the React logo again.

## Add a stylesheet

We've created a stylesheet for this app that you can reference in your `index.html` file in the `public` folder. in the `<head>` section, add the following:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://aserto-remote-css.netlify.app/react-and-node-quickstart.css"
/>
```

Next, we’ll build the app itself. Open the `App.js` file, and replace it’s contents with:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useAuth } from "oidc-react";

function App() {
  const auth = useAuth();
  const isAuthenticated = auth.userData?.id_token ? true : false;

  //If the user logs out, redirect them to the login page
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!auth.isLoading && !isAuthenticated) {
      auth.signIn();
    }
  });

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="header">
        <div className="logo-container">
          <div className="logo"></div>
          <div className="brand-name"></div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="user-controls">
        {isAuthenticated && (
          <>
            <div className="user-info">{auth.userData?.profile?.email}</div>
            <div className="seperator"></div>
            <div className="auth-button">
              <div onClick={() => auth.signOut("/")}>Log Out</div>
            </div>
          </>
        )}
        {!isAuthenticated && (
          <div className="auth-button">
            <div onClick={() => auth.signIn("/")}>Login</div>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>

      <div className="main">
        {isAuthenticated && (
          <>
            <div className="top-main">
              <div className="welcome-message">
                Welcome {auth.userData?.profile?.email}!
              </div>
            </div>
          </>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Test the application

Let's test our application by logging in. If it's not already running, start your application by executing:

```
yarn start
```

If you haven't already, log in, using the following credentials:

Email address: euang@acmecorp.com

Password: V@erySecre#t123!

![acmecorp-login](/quickstart-react-and-node/acmecorp-login.png)

If everything works as expected, the following should be displayed.

![welcome-euan-message](/quickstart-react-and-node/welcome-euan-message.png)

We can make sure that the application's authentication flow works by logging out and then logging back in.

Great! Our application authenticates with the Acmecorp IDP, and so we have our user's identity in hand. Next, [we'll create the Express.js service](service-setup) which will host our protected resource and will communicate with the Aserto hosted authorizer to determine whether or not a logged in user has the permissions to access the protected resource based on the user's identity.
