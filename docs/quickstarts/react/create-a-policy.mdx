# Creating a Role Based Access Control Authorization Model

Until now, we dealt only with **authentication** of users in our application. Now, let’s discuss how to set up the **authorization** model which will enforce some limitation on user access to our protected resource. We want to limit access to the protected resource in our application only to users who have particular _roles_.

As we saw before in the Aserto Directory, the user Euan (`euang@acmecorp.com`) has the `viewer` role, and the user Kris (`krisj@acmecorp.com`) has the `admin` role. Right now, if you log in as Euan user you’ll see the following:

![euan-gets-sensitive-information](/quickstart-react-and-node/euan-gets-sensitive-information.png)

We want to ensure that if we're logged in as Euan (a `viewer`), the application won't allow access to our protected resource. Since we didn't add any way to authorize users based on their role - all users will have access to the protected resource. Let's fix that by first creating a simple Aserto policy to allow access only to users with the `admin` role. We'll then use this policy in our application.

## Create an Aserto Policy

Initially, the policy we’ll create for this tutorial will only allow a user with the role of `admin` to access our protected resource, while users without the `admin` role will not be able to access that resource.

In [console.aserto.com](https://console.aserto.com), go to the Policies tab and click the "Create a policy repository" button.

When you click on "Create a policy repository", you'll be able to choose between using a policy template and creating an empty policy repository:

<img src="/use-template-options.png" width="700px" />

Select "Use a template" and click "Continue".

Next, you'll go through a short workflow to select a git repository for your policy, and name that policy in the Aserto console.

If you haven't already added a source code connection, select "Add a new source code connection". You can choose either adding a GitHub connection using an OAuth2 flow, or add a GitHub connection using a GitHub PAT.

Once you've added the connection, select the organization you'd like to use for the repository. Then, from the template dropdown, select "aserto-dev/policy-template". Name repo "policy-aserto-react", and click "Create repo".

<img src="/quickstart-react-and-node/select-org-and-repo.png" width="600px" />

Finally, name your policy repository "aserto-react" and click "Create a new policy repository".

<img src="/quickstart-react-and-node/name-policy.png" width="600px" />

Aserto will generate a new repository in your GitHub account the will include the necessary policy files. Head to GitHub to retrieve the URL for the repository that was just created, and clone it.

```
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR ORGANIZATION>/hello-aserto-react.git
```

Now that we have a local copy of the policy, let’s start modifying it:

We'll start by updating the `.manifest` file under `src`. We'll change it from

```
{
    "roots": ["policies"]
    ...
}
```

To

```
{
    "roots": ["asertodemo"]
    ...
}
```

Rename the file `hello.rego` to `protected.rego`. We'll open the file and change the package name to match the path of our Express API endpoint. The basic structure of the package name is:

```
[policy-root].[VERB].[path]
```

Where the path is separated by dots instead of slashes. And so in our case, the Express.js path

```
app.get('/api/protected'...
```

Is referenced in the package as:

```
package asertodemo.GET.api.protected
```

We're also going to define the policy such that the only `allowed` user is one with an `admin` role. Aserto attaches this `user` object to the `input` object. Below is the finished policy:

```
package asertodemo.GET.api.protected

default allowed = false

allowed {
	some index
	input.user.properties.roles[index] == "admin"
}
```

By default, the `allowed` decision is going to be `false` - this follows the principle of a “closed” system where access is disallowed unless specific conditions are satisfied.

At runtime, the application will send the JWT associated with the logged in user. The Express.js service will relay the JWT along with the request path as the identity and resource contexts respectively to the authorizer.

The `some index` and `...roles[index]` expressions indicate the authorizer will iterate over all the elements in the `roles` array under the `properties` in the user object. The authorizer will check if the iterated role is equal to the string `admin`. If it is, the `allowed` decision will evaluate to `true`.

## Updating the Policy Repository

Now that we’ve modified our policy, we’ll publish our changes: Aserto applies a GitOps flow to any changes made to the repository we set up. That means that we can simply tag and push the changes we’ve made to the policy and the updated policy will be built and published to the policy instance.

Commit, tag and push the changes you made:

```
git add .
git commit -m "updated policy"
git push
git tag v0.0.1
git push --tags
```

Open the Aserto console, and navigate to the Registry tab. Then, open the policy "hello-aserto-react" and review the changes. You should see the following:

<img src="/quickstart-react-and-node/policy-repo-details.png" />

## Create a policy instance

To set up a policy instance, head to the Policies tab and click the "Create an instance" button:

<img
  src="/quickstart-react-and-node/create-instance-button.png"
  width="160px"
/>

Next, you'll be prompted to select a policy registry:

<img src="/select-policy-registry.png" width="500px" />

Select "Aserto Policy Registry" from the dropdown.

Next, from the "Select organization" dropdown select your personal (account) organization.

<img src="/select-policy-organization.png" width="500px" />

From the "Policy repository" dropdown, select "aserto-react".

<img src="/quickstart-react-and-node/select-policy-repo.png" width="500px" />

From the "Tag list" dropdown, select "latest". This sets up the policy instance to always pick up the _latest_ version of the policy. While this is going to be very useful while we are developing the policy - we would probably choose to lock the policy instance to a specific tag in a production environment.

<img src="/select-tag.png" width="500px" />

Finally, name your policy instance `aserto-react` and click "Create an instance".

<img src="/quickstart-react-and-node/name-policy-instance.png" width="500px" />

## Checkpoint

Great! We now have a policy that will only allow users with the `admin` role access our protected resource. In the [next section](use-express-middleware) we'll see how to reference the policy in our Express.js service.
