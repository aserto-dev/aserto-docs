# Policies

Aserto manages the workflow and lifecycle for authorization policies. A policy is composed of a set of 
Rego files and (optionally) json data files. Aserto promotes treating these policies as code, just 
like you would application code and infrastructure-as-code. 

In the Aserto Console, you can create a Policy reference to a git repository by connecting to the 
source code provider, choosing a repository (or cloning one from a template), and naming it.

To list the policies that Aserto is managing for you, use the following command:

```bash
aserto tenant list-policy-references
```

## Policies are references

A policy is a named reference to a git repository. A policy therefore requires Aserto to be connected 
to the source code control system that manages the git repository. These are known as Connections, 
described next.
