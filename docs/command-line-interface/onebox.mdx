# Local developer experience (OneBox)

Aserto's authorizer is available as a docker container that you can run locally. 
This "all-in-one" version of the Aserto Authorizer is referred to as the **OneBox**.

The CLI provides a management experience over the OneBox.

> Note: the OneBox requires `docker` to be installed and running. 
> To install Docker on a Mac or Linux system: `brew install --cask docker`

To get started with the OneBox, you can pull it down using the Aserto CLI.

Login to your Aserto account:
```bash
aserto login
```

The following command will pull down the latest `aserto-one` docker image.

```bash
aserto developer install  
```

The next command will pull down the configuration for a policy that you've set up in the console, using 
the name you gave it (in the example below, `peoplefinder`).

```bash
aserto developer configure peoplefinder 
```

The following command will `docker run` a local container with the `peoplefinder` policy configuration:

```bash
aserto developer start peoplefinder 
```

You can use the next command to open a browser window that shows a local version of the console, to 
see what policies and users the local authorizer has. It also has a Rego playground and an API explorer 
that allow you to experiment with the Aserto authorization system.

```bash
aserto developer console  # will show you what the local authorizer is running
```

The next few commands help manage the `aserto-one` docker instance and image.

```bash
aserto developer status   # displays the running status of the authorizer
aserto developer stop     # stops the authorizer
aserto developer update   # updates the authorizer image to :latest
```
