# Managing Tenants

As a Tenant Owner, you can invite other members to your tenant, and control the roles and 
permissions for other members of your tenant.

Naturally, Aserto uses an Aserto [authorization policy](https://github.com/aserto-dev/policy-aona) 
to manage access to the Aserto APIs that expose Aserto's functionality (including through the Console and CLI).

The Aserto roles are described [here](/overview/tenant).

## Switching tenants

On the main navbar, you'll find the Tenant Dropdown. In this dropdown, you'll find all of the tenants 
that you have access to. To switch a tenant context, simply choose a tenant name from the dropdown:

## Managing the current tenant

To manage the currently selected tenant, choose the **Manage tenant** menu item from the dropdown.

## Inviting a user to a tenant

![invite member](/invite-member.png)

To invite a new user to a tenant, go to **Manage Tenant** screen, click the **Invite member...** button, and enter their email. If the 
user exists in the Aserto directory, they will be invited to join the tenant as a Viewer. If they don't 
yet have an Aserto account, they will be invited to create one and change their password.

> Note: every new user is invited to a tenant as a **Viewer**, to maintain the principle of least 
> privilege. Once a new user has accepted an invitation, a Tenant Owner can upgrade their role.

> Note: if a tenant invitation isn't accepted or declined within a week, that invitation will expire.

## Managing invitations

A tenant owner can view the status of invitations, and cancel invitations that are still pending.

## Change member roles

Once a new member has accepted their invitation to join a tenant, as a tenant owner, you can change 
the role of that user in the context of this tenant using the role dropdown.

## Remove a member from a tenant

As a tenant owner, you can remove a member from a tenant by selecting the **Remove member from tenant** 
item in the role dropdown.  Also, as a member of a tenant, you can remove yourself from the tenant using 
the same menu item, unless you're the last remaining owner.

> Note: Every tenant must have at least one owner.
