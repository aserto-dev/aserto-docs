# Viewing Policies

Clicking on a policy listed in the Policies view will connect to the hosted Authorizer and 
provide details on the policy modules in that policy, as well as settings information 
such as the policy ID and tenant information.

## Viewing policy files 

The policy files (also known as modules) that are loaded in the hosted Authorizer can be browsed 
by selecting the package name that corresponds to the module.

## Viewing policy settings

The policy settings contain important information that an application must pass into the Authorizer 
in order to have it make an authorization decision.  This includes:
* Policy name: the root of the policy (by convention, the same as the application name)
* Policy ID: the GUID for this particular policy (required for the [Policy Context](/authorizer-guide/policy-context))
* Authorizer API key: the API key that goes with this tenant, required to call the hosted Authorizer 
* Tenant ID: the tenant ID which scopes the Policy ID and Authorizer API key
