# Managing Connections

The Aserto Control Plane manages [connections](/overview/connections) to external systems that are 
the source of Aserto artifacts.

Click on the “Connections” Navbar tab to see your connections.

## Connection types

The Console currently supports two connection types - Identity Providers and Source Code Control systems. 
In addition, Aserto manages system connections to the Aserto Registry and to the multi-tenant Aserto Authorizer 
for each tenant.

## Connecting an Identity Provider

Aserto needs to connect to one or more identity providers as the source of user attributes and roles. 

> Currently Aserto supports Auth0 as an identity provider. More are on the way!

Click on the “Add a connection” button. You will be prompted to enter connection parameters:

Name your connection, and copy the Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret from the Auth0 UI into the Aserto UI.

> Note: the Auth0 application must be a machine-to-machine (M2M) application.

> For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Connect IDP](/getting-started/connect-idp) topic in the 
Getting Started documentation.

When you click the Connect button, Aserto will start streaming your Auth0 tenant users into 
the Aserto directory.

## Connecting a Source Code provider

> Currently Aserto supports GitHub as a source code provider. More are on the way!

### Connecting GitHub using the OAuth2 flow

To connect to GitHub using an OAuth2 flow, click on the "Add a connection" button and select "github". Name 
your connection (for example, `github-<account-name>`), and click "Add connection". Once you've completed the 
OAuth2 consent flow, your source code provider should show as connected.

### Connecting GitHub using a PAT

To connect to GitHub using a Personal Access Token (PAT), you need to create a PAT in the 
[GitHub UI](https://github.com/settings/tokens) by clicking the "Generate new token" button. 
Ensure that the selected scopes include at least `public_repo`, `read:org`, `read:user`, and `read:email` 
so that the Aserto Console has access to the required profile and repository information.

Once you've done that, switch back to the Aserto Console. Click on the "Add a connection" button and 
select "github-pat". Name your connection, copy the PAT value and paste it into the 
"GitHub Personal Access Token" field, and click "Add connection".

## Editing or removing a connection

Click the "..." handle on the right side of a connection entry, and select "Edit connection info..." or "Remove".
