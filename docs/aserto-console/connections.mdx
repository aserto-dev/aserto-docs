# Managing Connections

The Aserto Control Plane manages [connections](/docs/overview/connections) to external systems that are
the source of Aserto artifacts.

Click on the “Connections” tab to see your connections.

## Connection types

The console currently supports three connection types - Identity Providers, Source Code Control systems, and OCI registries (currently only the [Open Policy Registry](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/) is supported). In addition, Aserto manages system connections to the Aserto Registry and to the multi-tenant Aserto Authorizer for each tenant.

## Connecting an Identity Provider

Aserto needs to connect to one or more identity providers as the source of user attributes and roles.

:::note
Currently, Aserto supports Auth0 and Okta as an identity provider. More are on the way!
:::

Click on the “Add a connection” button. You will be prompted to enter connection parameters:

Name your connection, and copy the Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret from the Auth0 UI into the Aserto UI.

:::caution Note
The Auth0 application must be a machine-to-machine (M2M) application.
:::

:::info
For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Connect IDP](/docs/getting-started/connect-idp) topic in the
Getting Started documentation.
:::

When you click the Connect button, Aserto will start streaming your Auth0 tenant users into the Aserto directory.

## Connecting a Source Code provider

:::note
Currently Aserto supports GitHub as a source code provider. More are on the way!
:::

### Connecting GitHub using the OAuth2 flow

To connect to GitHub using an OAuth2 flow, click on the "Add a connection" button and select "github". Name
your connection (for example, `github-<account-name>`), and click "Add connection". Once you've completed the
OAuth2 consent flow, your source code provider should show as connected.

### Connecting GitHub using a PAT

To connect to GitHub using a Personal Access Token (PAT), you need to create a PAT in the
[GitHub UI](https://github.com/settings/tokens) by clicking the "Generate new token" button.
Ensure that the selected scopes include at least `public_repo`, `read:org`, `read:user`, and `user:email`
so that the Aserto Console has access to the required profile and repository information.

Once you've done that, switch back to the Aserto Console. Click on the "Add a connection" button and
select "github-pat". Name your connection, copy the PAT value and paste it into the
"GitHub Personal Access Token" field, and click "Add connection".

## Connecting to Open Policy Registry

Before adding a connection to the Open Policy Registry (OPCR), you need to [create an OPCR account](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/docs/opcr/create-account). If you haven't already done so, click [here](https://console.openpolicyregistry.io/) to sign up.

You'll also need to [set up a Github PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in order to connect your Aserto account to OPCR.

Once you've created an OPCR account and a Github PAT, navigate to the "Connections" tab click on the "Add a connection" button and select the `opcr` provider.

[<img src="/add-opcr-connection-select-opcr.png" width="500px" />](/add-opcr-connection-select-opcr.png)

Next, use your Github username and PAT to complete the form, and click "Add connection"

[<img src="/add-opcr-connection-username-password.png" width="500px" />](/add-opcr-connection-username-password.png)

Once you've added the new registry, you'll be able to select it when creating policy instances.

## Editing or removing a connection

Click the "..." handle on the right side of a connection entry, and select "Edit connection info..." or "Remove".
