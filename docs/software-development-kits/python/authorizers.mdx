# Authorizers

An `Authorizer` can be one of the [two types of supported authorizers](/docs/authorizer-guide/overview/#hosted-authorizer-vs-edge-authorizer):

## HostedAuthorizer

### Constructor arguments

- `api_key` (_required_): An Aserto Authorizer API Key
- `tenant_id` (_required_): An Aserto Tenant ID
- `service_type` (_required_): Either of the string values `"gRPC"` or `"REST"`, depending on the
  protocol desired to call the API

## Example

```py
from aserto import HostedAuthorizer

authorizer = HostedAuthorizer(
    api_key=YOUR_ASERTO_API_KEY,
    tenant_id=YOUR_ASERTO_TENANT_ID,
    service_type="REST",
)
```

## EdgeAuthorizer

### Constructor arguments

- `url` (_required_): The URL for the Authorizer service API
- `cert_file_path` (_required_): The location on the filesystem of the CA certificate that signed the
  Aserto authorizer self-signed certificate. See the "Certificates" section for more information
- `service_type` (_required_): Either of the string values `"gRPC"` or `"REST"`, depending on the
  protocol desired to call the API

## Example

```py
from aserto import EdgeAuthorizer

authorizer = EdgeAuthorizer(
    url=AUTHORIZER_SERVICE_URL,
    cert_file_path=FILE_PATH_TO_YOUR_AUTHORIZER_CA_CERTIFICATE,
    service_type="gRPC",
)
```

## Certificates

The Aserto [Authorizer](/docs/overview/authorizer) exposes HTTPS-only endpoints. In order for the API client to communicate with the authorizer, TLS certificates must be verified.

In a development environment, the Aserto [Sidecar](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/onebox) automatically creates a set of self-signed certificates and certificates of the CA (certificate authority) that signed them. It places them in a well-known location on the filesystem, defaulting to `$HOME/.config/aserto/sidecar/certs/`.

In order for the API client to perform the TLS handshake, it needs to verify the TLS certificate of the one-box using the certificate of the CA that signed it - which was placed in `$HOME/.config/aserto/sidecar/certs/gateway-ca.crt`.

Furthermore, when packaging a policy for deployment (e.g. in a Docker container) which uses the API client to communicate with an authorizer that has a self-signed TLS certificate, you must copy this CA certificate into the container as part of the Docker build (typically performed in the Dockerfile).
