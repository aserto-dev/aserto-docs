# HTTP Middleware

Using authorization middleware when building HTTP servers focuses the responsibility of making authorization decisions
to a single component instead of fragmenting the logic across all routes.

The middleware can be configured to retrieve authorization information, such as user identity, from incoming requests.

## Creating Middleware

Creating middleware requires two arguments: an [authorizer client](/docs/software-development-kits/go/authorizer),
and a `Policy` that identifies the authorization policy to be applied, the decision rule to evaluate, and optionally a
path to a policy module. If a path isn't provided, the middleware infers the policy path from the incoming
request's URL. This behavior too can be further customized to fit other naming schemes.

```go
import (
    middleware "github.com/aserto-dev/aserto-go/middleware/http"
)

...

// Create HTTP middleware.
mw := middleware.New(
    authClient,
    mw.Policy{
        ID:       "<Aserto policy ID>",
        Decision: "allowed",             // Name of the policy rule to evaluate.
    },
)
```

## Configuring Middleware

Middleware can be configured to extract authorization information from incoming requests. This information includes:

1. Identity: the identity of the caller.
2. Policy Path: the policy module to evaluate (e.g. `"peoplefinder.GET.api.users.__id"`).
3. Resource: contextual information about the resource being accessed.

### Identity

[Identity](/docs/authorizer-guide/identity-context) information is set on the middleware's `.Identity`.

For example, to configure the middleware to identify callers using a JWT in the `"Authorization"` HTTP header:

```go
mw.Identity.JWT().FromHeader("Authorization")
```

Or, to read a subject name from a `"username"` context value on the incoming request (presumably, set by some
authentication middleware):

```go
mw.Identity.Subject().FromContextValue("username")
```

### Policy Path

If a policy path isn't specified when the middleware is created, it will be inferred from the request URL starting with
the HTTP method, followed by the URL segments separated by dots (`.`). Path parameters are prefixed
with two underscores (e.g. `GET /users/{id}` becomes `GET.users.__id`).

To add a prefix to the generated path (e.g. `peoplefinder.GET.users.__id`) use:

```go
mw.WithPolicyFromURL("peoplefinder")
```

To provide your own logic for determining the policy path use:

```go
mw.WithPolicyPathMapper(
    func(r *http.Request) string {
        // custom logic inspects the request and returns the policy path.
    },
)
```

### Resource

[Resource](/docs/authorizer-guide/resource-context) information can be added to authorization requests using
`.WithResourceMapper()`:

```go
mw.WithResourceMapper(
    func(r *http.Request) *structpb.Struct {
        resourceContext, err := structpb.NewStruct(map[string]string{
            "ownerId": GetOwner(r),  // Custom function to retrieve the owner of the resource being accessed.
        })
        if err != nil {
            return resourceContext
        }

        return nil
    },
)
```

## Connecting Middleware

With a configured middleware in hand, all that's left is connecting it to your HTTP router.
The way you do that may differ depending on the library/framework you use, but they all follow similar patterns.

### net/http

Using just the built-in `net/http` package:

```go
func Hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte(`"hello"`))
}

// Create a router.
mux := http.NewServeMux()

// Attach middleware to route handler.
mux.Handle("/", mw.Handler(http.HandlerFunc(Hello)))

```

### gorilla/mux

The popular [`gorilla/mux`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/mux) package lets you set apply middleware to all
routes:

```go
func Hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte(`"hello"`))
}

r := mux.NewRouter()  // Create new gorilla/mux Router.
r.Use(mw)             // Attach authorization middleware to all routes.

r.HandleFunc("/", Hello) // Define route.
```
