# HTTP Middleware

Using authorization middleware when building HTTP servers focuses the responsibility of making authorization decisions
to a single component instead of fragmenting the logic across all routes.

The middleware can be configured to retrieve authorization information, such as user identity, from incoming requests.

There are three flavors of the HTTP middleware:

* `middleware/httpz` provides middleware for HTTP servers using the standard [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) package.
* `middleware/gorillaz` provides middleware for HTTP servers using [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) routers.
* `middleware/ginz` provides middleware for HTTP servers using the [Gin web framework](https://gin-gonic.com).

## Installation

**net/http**:

```shell
go get github.com/aserto-dev/go-aserto/middleware/httpz
```

**gorilla/mux**:

```shell
go get github.com/aserto-dev/go-aserto/middleware/gorillaz
```

**Gin**:

```shell
go get github.com/aserto-dev/go-aserto/middleware/ginz
```

## Creating Middleware

Creating middleware requires two arguments: an [authorizer client](/docs/software-development-kits/go/authorizer),
and a `Policy` that identifies the authorization policy to be applied, the decision rule to evaluate, and optionally a
path to a policy module. If a path isn't provided, the middleware infers the policy path from the incoming
request's URL. This behavior too can be further customized to fit other naming schemes.

```go
import (
     "github.com/aserto-dev/aserto-go/middleware"
     "github.com/aserto-dev/aserto-go/middleware/httpz"
)

...

// Create HTTP middleware.
mw := httpz.New(
    azClient,
    middleware.Policy{
        Name:       "<aserto policy name>",
        Decision: "allowed",                // Name of the policy rule to evaluate.
    },
)
```

## Configuring Middleware

Middleware can be configured to extract authorization information from incoming requests. This information includes:

1. Identity: the identity of the caller.
2. Policy Path: the policy module to evaluate (e.g. `"peoplefinder.GET.api.users.__id"`).
3. Resource: contextual information about the resource being accessed.

### Identity

[Identity](/docs/authorizer-guide/identity-context) information is set on the middleware's `.Identity`.

For example, to configure the middleware to identify callers using a JWT in the `"Authorization"` HTTP header:

```go
mw.Identity.JWT().FromHeader("Authorization")
```

Or, to read a subject name from a `"username"` context value on the incoming request (presumably, set by some
authentication middleware):

```go
mw.Identity.Subject().FromContextValue("username")
```

### Policy Path

If a policy path isn't specified when the middleware is created, it will be inferred from the request URL starting with
the HTTP method, followed by the URL segments separated by dots (`.`). Path parameters are prefixed
with two underscores (e.g. `GET /users/{id}` becomes `GET.users.__id`).

To add a prefix to the generated path (e.g. `peoplefinder.GET.users.__id`) use:

```go
mw.WithPolicyFromURL("peoplefinder")
```

To provide your own logic for determining the policy path use:

```go
mw.WithPolicyPathMapper(
    func(r *http.Request) string {
        // custom logic inspects the request and returns the policy path.
    },
)
```

### Resource

[Resource](/docs/authorizer-guide/resource-context) information can be added to authorization requests using
`.WithResourceMapper()`:

```go
mw.WithResourceMapper(
    func(r *http.Request, resource map[string]interface{}) {
        // Custom function to retrieve the owner of the resource being accessed.
        resource["ownerId"] = GetOwner(r)
    },
)
```

## Connecting Middleware

With a configured middleware in hand, all that's left is connecting it to your HTTP router.
The way you do that may differ depending on the library/framework you use, but they all follow similar patterns.

### net/http

Using just the built-in `net/http` package:

```go
func Hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte(`"hello"`))
}

// Create a router.
mux := http.NewServeMux()

// Attach middleware to route handler.
mux.Handle("/hello", mw.HandlerFunc(Hello))

```

### gorilla/mux

The popular [`gorilla/mux`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/mux) package lets you set apply middleware to all
handlers in a router:

```go
func Hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	name = mux.Vars(r)["name"]
    w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(`"hello %s"`, name)))
}

r := mux.NewRouter()  // Create new gorilla/mux Router.
r.Use(mw)             // Attach authorization middleware to all routes.

r.HandleFunc("/hello/{name}", Hello) // Define route.
```

## Gin

The `middleware/ginz` package is similar to the `middleware/gorillaz` module but uses `gin.Context` instead of
`http.Request`.

```go
func Hello(c *gin.Context) {
	name = c.Params.ByName("name")
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, fmt.Sprintf("hello %s", name))
}
```

A Gin resource mapper would look like this:
```go
mw.WithResourceMapper(
    func(c *gin.Context, resource map[string]interface{}) {
        // Custom function to retrieve the owner of the resource being accessed.
        resource["ownerId"] = GetOwner(c)
    },
)
```
