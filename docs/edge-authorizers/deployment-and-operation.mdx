# Deployment and Operation

Edge authorizers can be deployed in various ways based on the application and target environment needs and requirements. In its most basic form, an authorizer is a Docker container instance, which can be deployed as a standalone service, sidecar, or development workstation.

An edge authorizer always operates in the context of a (single) Aserto organization and is assigned a specific policy to serve. This information is provided to the edge authorizer via a configuration file, which it uses to send a discovery call to the Aserto control plane.

## Edge Authorizer Flavors

A couple of flavors of edge authorizers are available:

- Onebox: a single-tenant, single policy authorizer with a built-in web UI, to be used as a developer workstation.
- Sidecar: a single-tenant, single policy authorizer without a web UI. The sidecar is the general edge authorizer flavor with a small surface area, which can be used as a sidecar but also as a local service instance.

## Docker images

| Flavor  | Image                                                    | Lates version |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Onebox  | docker pull ghcr.io/aserto-dev/authorizer-onebox:0.4.23  | 0.4.23        |
| Sidecar | docker pull ghcr.io/aserto-dev/authorizer-sidecar:0.4.23 | 0.4.23        |

## Running the Edge Authorizer

You can run the edge authorizer `aserto` CLI:

```sh
aserto developer start <POLICY_INSTANCE_NAME>
```

Or by using the `docker` CLI:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker run \
-ti \
--rm \
--name aserto-one \
--platform=linux/amd64 \
-p 8282:8282 \
-p 8383:8383 \
-p 8484:8484 \
-p 8585:8585 \
-v $PWD/certs:/app/certs:rw \
-v $PWD/cfg:/app/cfg:ro \
-v $PWD/eds:/app/db:rw \
ghcr.io/aserto-dev/authorizer-sidecar:0.4.23 run \
--config-file /app/cfg/config.yaml
```
