# Identity Context

When an Authorizer evaluates a policy, it receives an Identity Context from the calling application.
The Identity Context instructs the Authorizer whether and how to populate the `input.user` object
when evaluating the policy. The process of identifying the user referred to by the Identity Context
and loading it into the `input.user` object is known as "identity resolution".

An identity context contains two fields: `type` and `identity`.

The `type` of an Identity Context gives callers control over the identity resolution process:

- `IDENTITY_TYPE_NONE`: the policy is evaluated without a user context (`input.user` is empty).
  This is most commonly used to authorize anonymous requests.
- `IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB`: the `identity` field is a user identity such as email, username, or OAuth2 subject name.
- `IDENTITY_TYPE_JWT`: the `identity` field is a JWT access token. The authorizer extracts the `sub` (subject)
  claim from the token and uses it as the user identity.
- `IDENTITY_TYPE_MANUAL`: disables identity resolution. The identity context is available in the poilcy
  as `input.identity` but `input.user` is empty.

When using `IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB` or `IDENTITY_TYPE_JWT`, a user with the given identity must exist in
the authorizer's directory. If no such user exists, the authorizer returns an error.

In a user-facing API (e.g. a back-end REST API that requires a JWT in the `Authorization` header),
the token is typically decoded and validated during the _authentication_ phase. The service can then
extract the `sub` claim from the JWT and pass it to the authorizer with `IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB`.
Alternately, the entire JWT can be forwarded to the authorizer with `IDENTITY_TYPE_JWT` but the
authorizer would then decode and validate the token too.


## Setting the Identity Context

The `is`, `query`, and `decisiontree` API calls all take an `identityContext` map:

`POST .../api/v2/authz/is`

```json
{
  "identityContext": {
    "identity": "[aserto-user-guid]",
    "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB"
  }, ...
}
```

To access the properties of the user in a policy, you can use `input.user`:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders
default allowed = false

# only allow salespeople
allowed {
  input.user.properties.department == "Sales"
}
```

## Using other JWT claims in a policy

Note that the `identityContext` is available as `input.identity`. If the policy wants to
extract additional claims out of a JWT and use them in the policy, it can readily do so.

Assuming the following `identityContext`:

`POST .../api/v2/authz/is`

```json
{
  "identityContext": {
    "identity": "[JWT that could contain a 'manager' claim]",
    "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_JWT"
  }, ...
}
```

The following policy will extract the JWT using the `io.jwt.decode()` Rego built-in, make it available
as `token.payload`, and use claims in the payload within the policy:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders
default allowed = false

# Helper to get the token payload
token = {"payload": payload} {
  [header, payload, signature] := io.jwt.decode(input.identity.identity)
}

# only allow sales managers
allowed {
  input.user.properties.department == "Sales"
  token.payload.manager
}
```
