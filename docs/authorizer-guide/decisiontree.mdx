# authz/decisiontree

The `decisiontree` API allows the caller to get the value of any decisions across ALL policy modules, 
with a user context, but without a resource context. 

This API is useful for getting a "decision tree" that guides a calling application around what 
functionality will be available to a user based on their context. 

It is used by the the [**display state map**](/authorizer-guide/display-state-map) middleware in SDKs 
such as the [Aserto Express.js SDK](/software-development-kits/express#displaystatemap-middleware), in 
conjunction with the [Aserto React SDK](/software-development-kits/react), that is useful in 
conditionally rendering UI elements based on the **display state** that corresponds to a decision. 

The inputs to the `decisiontree` API are the user context, the set of decisions that the calling 
application wants to evaluate, the (optional) policy module used to make the decision(s), the (optional)
resource context, and a set of options.

## URL

`POST .../api/v1/authz/decisiontree`

## Input payload

```json
{
  "identityContext": {
    "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB",
    "identity": "<subject>"
  }, 
  "policyContext": {
    "decisions": [
      "visible", "enabled"
    ],
    "id": "[policy-id]",
    "path": "sample",
  },
  "resourceContext": {
    "additionalProp1": "string",
    "additionalProp2": "string",
    "additionalProp3": "string"
  },
  "options": {
    "pathSeparator": "SLASH"
  }
}
```

The `identityContext` map is documented [here](/authorizer-guide/identity-context).

The `policyContext` map is documented [here](/authorizer-guide/policy-context).

The `resourceContext` map is documented [here](/authorizer-guide/resource-context).

The `options` map allows the caller to specify the format for retrieving the cartesian product of 
paths and decisions that are being requested.

### Path separator

Path separator values are:
* SLASH: the key in the returned decision tree is of the form `VERB/route/segments/etc`
* DOT: the key in the returned decision tree is of the form `VERB.route.segments.etc`

## Output payload

The return payload for the options above may look like the following:

```json
{
  "GET/api/orders": {
    visible: true,
    enabled: true
  }
}
```
