# authz/decisiontree

The `decisiontree` API allows the caller to get the value of any decisions across ALL policy modules, with a user context, but without a resource context.

This API is useful for getting a "decision tree" that guides a calling application around what functionality will be available to a user based on their context.

It is used by the the [**display state map**](/docs/authorizer-guide/display-state-map) middleware in SDKs such as the [Aserto Express.js SDK](/docs/software-development-kits/javascript/express#displaystatemap-middleware), in conjunction with the [Aserto React SDK](/docs/software-development-kits/javascript/react), that is useful in conditionally rendering UI elements based on the **display state** that corresponds to a decision.

The inputs to the `decisiontree` API are the user context, the set of decisions that the calling application wants to evaluate, the (optional) policy module used to make the decision(s), the (optional) resource context, and a set of options.

## URL

`POST .../api/v2/authz/decisiontree`

## Input payload

```json
{
  "identityContext": {
    "type": "IDENTITY_TYPE_SUB",
    "identity": "<subject>"
  },
  "policyContext": {
    "decisions": ["visible", "enabled"],
    "path": "sample"
  },
  "policyInstance": {
    "name": "[policy-name]",
    "instanceLabel": "[instance-label]"
  },
  "resourceContext": {
    "additionalProp1": "string",
    "additionalProp2": "string",
    "additionalProp3": "string"
  },
  "options": {
    "pathSeparator": "PATH_SEPARATOR_SLASH"
  }
}
```

The `identityContext` map is documented [here](/docs/authorizer-guide/identity-context).

The `policyContext` map is documented [here](/docs/authorizer-guide/policy-context).

The `policyInstance` map is documented [here](/docs/authorizer-guide/policy-instance).

The `resourceContext` map is documented [here](/docs/authorizer-guide/resource-context).

The `options` map allows the caller to specify the format for retrieving the cartesian product of
paths and decisions that are being requested.

### Path separator

Path separator values are:

- PATH_SEPARATOR_SLASH: the key in the returned decision tree is of the form `VERB/route/segments/etc`
- PATH_SEPARATOR_DOT: the key in the returned decision tree is of the form `VERB.route.segments.etc`

## Output payload

The return payload for the options above may look like the following:

```json
{
  "GET/api/orders": {
    "visible": true,
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Upgrading from v1

To upgrade from the v1 Policy Context, see this [topic](/docs/authorizer-guide/upgrading-from-v1.mdx).

# Deprecated v1 authz/decisiontree API

The `decisiontree` API allows the caller to get the value of any decisions across ALL policy modules, with a user context, but without a resource context.
