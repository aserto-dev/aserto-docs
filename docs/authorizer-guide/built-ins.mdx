# Built-in Functions

Aserto provides a set of built-in functions that can be used in your policy. These functions make it easier to leverage information found the Aserto directory.

### `ds.identity`

```js
ds.identity({
  "id": "<value>"
})
```
Looks up a user identity by one of the ids (e.g. email address or PID), and returns the `identifier` of the user object associated to the identity instance.

For example: `ds.identity({ "id": "euang@acmecorp.com" })` will return `dfdadc39-7335-404d-af66-c77cf13a15f8`.

### `ds.object`

```js
ds.object({
  "object_type": "<object type>",
  "object_id": "<object identifier>",
  "with_relations": <boolean>
})
```
Returns an object instance looked up by the combination of `<type>` and `<id>`.

For example: `ds.object({ "type": "identity", "id": "euang@acmecorp.com" })` will return the identity object associated with Euan.

If `with_relations` is included and set to `true`, the response includes all the relation instances.


### `ds.relation`

```js
ds.relation({
  "object_type": "<object type>",
  "object_id": "<object identifier>",
  "relation": "<relation name>",
  "subject_type": "<subject type>",
  "subject_id": "<subject identifier>",
  "subject_relation": "subject relation name>",
  "with_objects": <boolean>
})
```
Returns the relation instance that connects the subject with the object through the relation identified by `<object type>` and `<relation name>`.
If `with_objects` is included and set to `true`, the response includes all the subject and object instances.

### `ds.relations`

```js
ds.relations({
  "object_type": "<object type>",
  "object_id": "<object identifier>",
  "relation": "<relation name>",
  "subject_type": "<subject type>",
  "subject_id": "<subject identifier>",
  "subject_relation": "subject relation name>",
  "with_objects": <boolean>,
  "with_empty_subject_relation": <boolean>
})
```

Returns the relation instances that connects the search criteria.
If `with_objects` is included and set to `true`, the response includes all the subject and object instances.

### `ds.check`

```js
ds.check({
  "object_type": "<object type>",
  "object_id": "<object identifier>",
  "relation": "<relation or permission name>",
  "subject_type": "<subject type>",
  "subject_id": "<subject identifier>",
  "trace":  <boolean>
})
```

An object is identified by the combination of its `<object type>` and `<object identifier>`. The same is true for a subject.

A relation type is uniquely identified by the object type name and the relation name. A relation instance of that type will relate an object instance to a subject instance.

`ds.check` returns `true` if the object instance has a relation or permission of the type specified to the subject instance.


### `ds.check_relation` (Obsolete, please use `ds.check`)

```js
ds.check_relation({
  "object_type": "<object type>",
  "object_id": "<object identifier>",
  "relation": "<relation name>",
  "subject_type": "<subject type>",
  "subject_id": "<subject identifier>",
  "trace":  <boolean>
})
```
An object is identified by the combination of its `<object type>` and `<object identifier>`. The same is true for a subject.

A relation type is uniquely identified by the object type name and the relation name. A relation instance of that type will relate an object instance to a subject instance.

`ds.check_relation` returns `true` if the object instance has a relation of the type specified to the subject instance.

### `ds.check_permission` (Obsolete, please use `ds.check`)

```js
ds.check_permission({
  "object_type": "<object type>",
  "object_id": "<object identifier>",
  "permission": "<permission name>",
  "subject_type": "<subject type>",
  "subject_id": "<subject identifier>",
  "trace":  <boolean>
})
```
An object is identified by the combination of its `<object type>` and `<object identifier>`. The same is true for a subject.

`ds.check_permission` returns`true` if the subject has the permission `<permission name>` referenced through one or more relations to the object.

### `ds.graph`

```js
ds.graph({
    "object_type": "<object type>",
    "object_id": "<object identifier>",
    "relation": "<relation name>",
    "subject_type": "<subject type>",
    "subject_id": "<subject identifier>",
    "subject_relation": "<subject relation>",
    "explain": <boolean>,
    "trace":  <boolean>
})
```

Searches the graph to find all subjects of a given type with a specified relation to a given subject or vice versa, all objects of a given type that a specified subject has a given relation to.

The `object_type`, `subject_type`, and `relation` values are required in addition to one of the `object_id` or `subject_id` values.

If `object_id` is provided, the results include all subjects of the specified `subject_type` that have the relation to the object.
If `subject_id` is provided, the results include all objects of the specified type with which the subject has the given relation.

If `explain` is set to `true` the output also includes all the graph paths that connect the given object or subject with the returned results.
