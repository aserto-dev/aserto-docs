# Resource Context

When an Authorizer evaluates a policy, it may optionally receive a Resource Context from the calling application. 

The `resourceContext` is a key-value map that is passed into the authorizer and materialized 
as `input.resource` in the policy. This allows a policy to evaluate a decision in the context of both a user 
as well as a more specific resource (or set of resource attributes).

One common use case for the resource context is to drive lookup tables that match up resources to their owners. 
As a simple example, let's say you have a sales order that is owned by a user in the system, and you 
only want that user to be able to view the sales order.  

Passing in the following `resourceContext`:

```json
"resourceContext": {
  "ownerId": "[owner-resource-id]"
}
```

You can use this in a policy as follows:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders
default allowed = false

allowed {
  input.user.id == input.resource.ownerId
}
```

If the logged-in user's ID is the same as the ownerId passed in for the sales order, the `allowed`
decision will evaluate to `true`.
