# Aserto Tenants

The tenant provides the  context for the artifacts that are managed by Aserto - 
[*connections*](/overview/connections), [*policies*](/overview/policy-lifecycle), and the 
[*user directory*](/overview/directory). You can think of it like a GitHub organization.

Every tenant has at least one owner. It can also have members and viewers.

## Artifacts

Aserto manages the following artifacts for a tenant:
* [Connections](/overview/connections) - these are connections to external systems such as source code control systems and identity providers
* [Policies](/overview/policy-lifecycle) - these are references to git repositories that store authorization policies
* [User Directory](/overview/directory) - these are the users that Aserto has synched from one or more connected identity providers

## Role-based access control

Naturally, Aserto uses Aserto for authorization, using a simple role-based access control (RBAC) model.

The roles that Aserto supports:
* Owner: can perform all operations on a tenant, including inviting other viewers, members, and owners, as well as reset the role of another member of the tenant
* Member: can perform all operations on a tenant except inviting others to the tenant or managing tenant membership
* Viewer: allowed to see all tenant information, but not create or edit any tenant artifacts

The Aserto policy for the Aserto API can be found [here](https://github.com/aserto-dev/policy-aona).
