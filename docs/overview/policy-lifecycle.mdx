# Policy Lifecycle

## Policy 

At the core of Aserto’s authorization model is an authorization policy, which we refer to simply 
as a **Policy**. Policies are authored in a textual language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/),
defined as part of the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) project in the 
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). Policies are treated just like application code or 
infrastructure-as-code - they are stored and versioned in a git repository.

## The policy lifecycle

Policies are **authored** using a text / code editor, **built** into an image, **published** to a repository hosted on 
a registry, **run** in an Authorizer, and **consumed** by an application.

Aserto's control plane helps manage the policy lifecycle.

### Author

Policies are comprised of a collection of `.rego` files and `.json` files, which provide static data that 
can be part of the policy.

### Build 

The set of source files that comprise a policy are built into a **Policy Image** using a set of tools that 
are modeled after the `docker` toolset.  You can build and tag a policy just like you build and tag a docker image.

> Currently, the Aserto control plane wires up directly to a git repository that contains policy files, and 
> does not expose the policy image directly. A GitHub **build action** automatically builds a new version of 
> a policy image when the source repository is **tagged** with a new tag:

```bash
git commit -am 'new policy version'
git tag v0.1.2 && git push --tags
```

### Publish 

You can push a policy image to a **Policy Repository**, which is hosted in a **Policy Registry**, such as `registry.prod.aserto.com`.

You can pull a policy image from a Policy Repository just like you pull a docker image.

> Currently, the Aserto Policy Registry is not exposed using a public API. The GitHub action will build 
> a policy image and push it to the Aserto Policy Registry when the repo is tagged. In the future, the Policy 
> Registry will support a set of public operations very similar to a Docker registry.

**GitHub Actions Secret**

Aserto can set up a secret for you when you create a new policy.
You can also setup this secret yourself, using information from the **Policy Settings** tab in the Aserto Console.
The secret is a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "tenant_id": "",
  "policy_id": "",
  "push_key": ""
}
```

### Run

You can run a policy image, which loads it into an **Authorizer** instance.  

> Currently, Authorizers will automatically load and run the latest policy version stored in the  
> Policy Registry. In the future, Authorizers will be able to load run an explicit version of a policy image.

### Consume

An application that wants to authorize a user's access to a resource based on the policy can call the Authorizer, 
passing it the policy, decision(s), user context, and resource context, and the Authorizer will evaluate the 
policy with the provided inputs and returns the boolean value(s) of the requested decision(s), allowing the 
application to definitively check whether the user has access to the resource based on the given policy.

The [`authz.is`](/authorizer-guide/is) API is the underlying mechanism for an application to call the 
Authorizer to make a decision. The [language SDKs](/software-development-kits/sdks) provide higher-level abstractions for interacting 
with the authorizer.
