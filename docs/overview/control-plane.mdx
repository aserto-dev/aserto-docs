# Control Plane

The Aserto Control Plane manages the lifecycle of **policies**, **user context**, and **data** that are
used by the Authorizer. The control plane makes it easy to manage these artifacts centrally, and
takes care of the details of synchronizing them to the Authorizer instance(s) deployed at the edge.

## Tenants

An Aserto tenant provides the scoping and isolation mechanism for artifacts managed by the Aserto Control Plane. There 
are two types of tenants:
* **Accounts**: every user has a personal account, where they can create and manage artifacts
* **Organizations**: users can create an [organization](/docs/overview/organization), invite other users to join, and assign them a role (viewer, member, admin, owner).

:::tip
You can think of an account just like a GitHub account, and an organization just like a GitHub organization.

Each tenant (whether an account or organization) has a unique Tenant ID, which is used by the Aserto CLI to determine which tenant to manage. 
It is also used by client applications to indicate which tenant to interact with.

## Artifacts

The artifacts that are managed per-tenant are:

- [Connections](/docs/overview/connections): connections to external systems such as identity providers and source code control systems
- [Policies](/docs/overview/policy-lifecycle): references to a set of authorization policy repositories
- [User directory](/docs/overview/directory): the meta-directory that Aserto builds from the identity providers that it is connected to
- [Decision logs](/docs/overview/decision-logs): a centralized log of the aggregated decisions that are made by authorizers
