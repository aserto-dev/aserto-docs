# Schemas

## Storage Objects

Decision logs storage object are CSV files. Each one contains the following columns:

- `decision_id`: A unique id for the authorizer call that generated the decision. A call can generate more than one
  decision, so there can be multiple rows with the same `decision_id` value
- `decision_time`: The UTC time when the decision call was executed by an authorizer
- `user_id`: The ID of the user in the user context of the authorizer call
- `policy_id`: The ID of the policy that was evaluated by the authorizer call
- `path`: The policy path evaluated by the authorizer call
- `decision`: The name of a decision evaluated by the authorizer call
- `outcome`: The outcome, true or false, of the decision
- `resource`: The resource context as passed to the authorizer call

## Query results

Each result of the [query](/docs/decision-logs-guide/query) and [decisions](/docs/decision-logs-guide/api/decisions) APIs is
a JSON object encoded as a string; once decoded, it has a structure similar to the following example:

```json

  "decision_id": "f506be2f-97d5-4d3d-93a1-91e7623038af",
